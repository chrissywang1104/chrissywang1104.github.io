        <p>Q8: How was the trip back to your home country? How was your quarantine life like?</p>
        <p>A: It was complete tourture. 
            <br> I needed to wear a protective suit during the whole ride to Taiwan, and I couldn't even eat on the plane. 
            Also, I had to quarantine for 2 weeks amid school finals and application deadlines.</p>
