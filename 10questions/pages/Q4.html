        <p>Q4: Do you like it better to be in your home country? 
            <br>Or would you prefer to be in NYC?</p>
        <p>A: I would prefer to take in-campus classes in NYC. 
            <br>Itâ€™ll be a new challenge for me since I've never been there.
            <br> Also, I prefer in-person classes, since they are more effective than online classes.
