        <p>Q1: What is your schedule like this semester?</p>
        <p>A: I am currently taking 5 classes this semester, consisting of 3 communication design courses with 2 first-year requirements. 
            <br>And because I’m a transfer student, I have enough electives to make up for liberal arts. 
            <br>Though it’s only the first week of class, I’m already feeling an intensive workload awaiting in the future.</p>
